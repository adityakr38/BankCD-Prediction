### Bank CD Prediction Project (If you are having trouble understanding the project, you can navigate to the Model.ipynb file, where you can find the code for model development.)

## Aim
The aim of this project is to develop an efficient machine learning model for predicting whether a client will enroll in a Certificate of Deposit (CD), optimizing Bank's marketing efforts and reducing costs.

## Description
This is an end-to-end machine learning project:
- **Model**: XGBoost with ROC-AUC of 91%.
- **Deployment**: AWS and CI/CD pipeline.
- **Codebase**: Modular and scalable.

## Features
- Predicts customer enrollment in CDs.
- Fully automated data preprocessing and model training pipeline.
- Real-time deployment for predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Deployment**: AWS, Docker, Github Actions (CI/CD pipeline)
- **Version Control**: Git
